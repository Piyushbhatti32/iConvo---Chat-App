# 👤 Username Change Feature - User Guide

## 🎯 How to Change Your Username

The iConvo chat application now supports **real-time username changes** while you're chatting! Here's how to use this feature:

### 🖱️ Simple Methods

#### Method 1: Click and Type
1. **Click** on your username in the name field (top of the chat)
2. The field will highlight with a blue border and show editing hints
3. **Edit** your desired username
4. **Click away** from the field or press **Enter** to apply the change

#### Method 2: Auto-Change (1-second delay)
1. **Click** on your username field
2. **Type** your new username
3. **Stop typing** for 1 second - the change will apply automatically

### ✅ Visual Feedback

When you interact with the username field, you'll see:

- **🔵 Blue highlighting** when focused
- **💡 Helpful tip** showing "Press Enter or click away to change username"
- **🔄 Loading message** when the change is being processed
- **✅ Success message** when your username is updated
- **❌ Error message** if the username is already taken

### 🚫 What Happens if Username is Taken?

If someone else in the room already has your desired username:

- You'll see an **❌ error message**: "Username 'NewName' is already taken in this room"
- Your **username will revert** back to your current one
- The field will be **automatically selected** for easy correction
- Just **try a different name**!

### 📋 Username Rules

- **Length**: Maximum 50 characters
- **Cannot be empty**
- **Must be unique** in each chat room
- **Anonymous users** get auto-numbered (Anonymous1, Anonymous2, etc.)

### 🔧 Advanced Features

#### Anonymous Users
- If you keep the name "Anonymous", you'll get an auto-assigned number
- Your number persists across reconnections in the same room
- Each room has separate anonymous numbering

#### Real-time Updates
- Other users see your name change **instantly**
- Your **message history keeps the old name** for clarity
- New messages show your **updated username**

### 🎨 Visual Enhancements

The username field now has enhanced visual cues:

- **Hover effect**: Slight highlight when you hover over it
- **Focus animation**: Smooth scaling and blue glow when active
- **Real-time hints**: Contextual tips when editing
- **Error highlighting**: Clear visual feedback for issues

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

#### Username Change Not Working?
1. **Make sure you're in a room** - you can't change usernames before joining
2. **Check your connection** - you need to be connected to the server
3. **Try a different name** - the username might already be taken
4. **Refresh the page** if you encounter persistent issues

#### Common Issues
- **"Please join a room first"** - Join a chat room before changing your username
- **"Username cannot be empty"** - Enter at least one character
- **"Username is too long"** - Use 50 characters or less
- **"Already taken"** - Choose a different username

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test different names** in different rooms - usernames are room-specific
2. **Keep it memorable** - other users will see this name in conversations
3. **Use the Enter key** for immediate changes instead of waiting for the auto-delay
4. **Join rooms first** - username changes only work when you're in a chat room

### 🔄 What Changed?

**Before the enhancement:**
- Users had to manually rejoin rooms to change names
- No real-time feedback
- Confusing process

**After the enhancement:**
- ✅ **Real-time username changes** without leaving the room
- ✅ **Visual feedback** and helpful hints
- ✅ **Automatic validation** and error handling
- ✅ **Smooth user experience** with hover effects and animations
- ✅ **Smart debouncing** - changes apply after 1 second of no typing
